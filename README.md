# Estimating skeletal muscle microstructural parameters from dMRI data
Code and model weights for paper: Naughton N, Cahoon S, Sutton B, and Georgiadis JG. Accelerated, physics-inspired inference of skeletal muscle microstructure from diffusion-weighted MRI. IEEE Tranactions on Medical Imaging, 2024.

Notes: 1) Code works with packages from circa September 2019, some current packages appear to have made breaking changes. 2) Gaussian process models take large amounts of RAM to load (~200 Gb per model) and will crash the python kernel otherwise.
