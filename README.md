# dMRI-muscle-inverse
Code and model weights for 2024 IEEE TMI paper on estimating microstructural parameters from dMRI data.

Notes: 1) Code works with packages from circa September 2019, some current packages appear to have made breaking changes. 2) Gaussian process models take large amounts of RAM to load (~200 Gb per model) and will crash the python kernel otherwise.
